# Movie-Website-front-and-backend

This is the repository for the movie website front and back end that I created during my back end web development module.

The website uses JSON web tokens and Axios for the server backend, for the database, it uses MySQL. As such, you will have to make some changes to the file
for it to use whatever database you want to use.
